# SplaveFerris
Ergonomic split keyboard running ZMK on a Seeed XIAO BLE controller. It has 34 keys and is similar in layout to the Ferris Sweep except with a bit of finger splay.

My goals are to make the keyboard as small and thin as possibe while remaining comfortable, efficient, and relatively durable. That is the main rationale for not using hotswap switches; in addition to adding a bit of height, it makes the keys much less secure if you aren't using a case of some kind. I intend to plastidip the bottom and otherwise leave it raw.

The board is designed to be primarily assembled with SMD methods. I use solder paste and a hotplate to surface mount the controller, button, switch, and all the diodes, leaving only the battery connector and keyswitches to manually solder.

This design uses Kailh Choc v1 switches. I originally intended to support multiple switch types, and even had a PG1316S version fully designed...but that had several problems and I decided to make it into its own project. Stay tuned!

The layout is done in ergogen, so it's relatively easy to adapt as needed.

I created a schematic, but while I believe it to be accurate, it is not connected to the PCB files in any way, as they were generated by ergogen.

I remain very new at all this stuff. So if you see something wrong, please let me know!
